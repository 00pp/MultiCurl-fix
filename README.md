Installation and basic usage can be found here: https://github.com/php-curl-class/php-curl-class/

This repository is a small fix of php-curl-class in order it would be possible to set proxy for MultiCurl requests. 

Here you can find a fix file that should be replaced in php-curl-class: MultiCurl.php
And usage example: example.php (MultiCurl.php should be replaced)
